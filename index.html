                <p><mark style="color:royalblue">Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an American children's book series and media
                        franchise created by author and
                        cartoonist Jeff Kinney. The series follows Greg Heffley, a middle-schooler who illustrates his
                        daily
                        life in a diary.</mark></p>
                <p>Kinney spent 8 years working on the book before showing it to a publisher.[4] In 2004, FunBrain and
                    Kinney released an online version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The website made daily entries from
                    September
                    2004 to June 2005.[5] The online version had received almost 20 million views by 2009. Nonetheless,
                    many
                    online readers requested a printed version. In February 2006, during the New York Comic Con, Kinney
                    signed a multi-book deal with publisher Abrams Books to turn Diary of a Wimpy Kid into a printed
                    book
                    series.[4] The first installment was released in April 2007[5] and received immediate success. In
                    April
                    2009, Time magazine named Kinney in the Time 100 most influential people.[6]

                    Seventeen books in the series have been released as of 2022, an activity book has also been
                    released. A
                    spin-off series, centering on the character Rowley Jefferson, has three installments as of 2021.[7]
                    The
                    first, second, fourth and ninth installments have been adapted into films by 20th Century Fox;[8]
                    two
                    books have been released chronicling the production of the films.

                    Since the release of the online version, most of the books have garnered positive reviews and
                    commercial
                    success. As of 2022, more than 275 million copies have been sold globally, making it the sixth
                    best-selling book series of all time.[9]</p>

            <p>Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a 2021 computer-animated comedy film directed by Swinton Scott (in his feature
                directorial debut) from a screenplay by Jeff Kinney, based on his 2007 book of the same name. It is the
                second film adaptation of the book following the 2010 live-action film while serving as the first
                fully-animated reboot in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series and the fifth installment overall. It
                features the voices of Brady Noon, Ethan William Childress, Chris Diamantopoulos, Erica Cerra, and
                Hunter Dillon.

                Diary of a Wimpy Kid was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Bardel Entertainment, with the latter
                providing animation services, and was released on Disney+, as a Disney+ original film, on December 3,
                2021. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the voice acting and animation, but criticized
                it for its short runtime and missing elements from the original book and film.</p>
